# **Introduction**

Welcome to our BlogPost App's technical documentaion. This application is a secure RESTful application built with Node.js, Express.JS, and MySQL. It allows user to register, log in and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations on blog posts. The API supports user authentication via JWT, raccess to post manipulation and includes error handling with centralized middleware.

## **About** BlogPost App

This application is designed as a backend service for a blogging platform, offering the following key features:
- **User Authentication**
    Secure registration and login using hashed passwords and JWT-based token verification.
- **Create & Manage Blog Posts**
    Authenticated users can create, edit and soft-delete posts. Ownership is verified to prevent unauthorized actions.
- **Pagination Support**
    Efficient data retrieval through GET /posts?page=X&limit=Y, with metadata including total count and page numbers.
- **Validation & Error Handling**
    Input is validated using express-validator, and all errors are caught via a centralized errorHandlerMiddleware.
- **Soft Deletion**
    Posts are not permanently removed but flagged (flag = 0) to preserve data integrity.

# Configuration

Configuring this application is an essential step to ensure it operates smoothly. In this section, the steps to configure the application will be explained.

## Instruction
1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/reinasyar/talentgrowth-BackendTest.git
    ```
    Clone the repostirory and move to folder
2. **Install Depedencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
    create a .env file in the root directory and add these following variables:
    ```env
    PORT=3000
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=your_mysql_username
    DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
    DB_NAME=your_database_name
    JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
    ```
    Make sure to replace the values with your actual database credentials and a secure JWT secret key.
4. **Configure MySQL Database**
    - Create a database in MySQL
        ```sql
        CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
        ```
    - Run the schema
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE users (
            id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
            email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
            password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
            name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
            created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
            flag INT DEFAULT 1,
            deleted_at DATETIME
        );
        CREATE TABLE posts (
            id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
            title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
            content TEXT NOT NULL,
            author VARCHAR(100),
            created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
            edited_at DATETIME,
            deleted_at DATETIME,
            flag INT DEFAULT 1,
            num_edit INT DEFAULT 0,
            user_id INT NOT NULL,
            FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
        );
        ```
5. **Run the Server**
    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```
